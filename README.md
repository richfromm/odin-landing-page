# odin-landing-page

This is the [Landing
Page](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-landing-page)
project from Foundations Course of The Odin Project.

The assignment is to mimic the page shown
[here](https://cdn.statically.io/gh/TheOdinProject/curriculum/81a5d553f4073e593d23a6ab00d50eef8620796d/foundations/html_css/project/imgs/01.png),
using colors and fonts and styles given
[here](https://cdn.statically.io/gh/TheOdinProject/curriculum/81a5d553f4073e593d23a6ab00d50eef8620796d/foundations/html_css/project/imgs/02.png).
Note that not all styling is explicitly specified.

The [Roboto](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Roboto#styles) font is
available from [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/).

Pictures are mine. Content is just filler, b/c after this much CSS
fiddling I'm feeling a bit lazy.
